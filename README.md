It’s a common complaint: My Windows PC is running slow. Annoyingly slow. You can add RAM, or buy a faster SSD, but that costs money. No, your first order of business should be an attempt to wring free performance from Windows. In the following nine steps we show you how to speed up your Windows 10 PC without spending a dime.


**Be warned:** There could be trade-offs. More speed could mean less battery life in the case of a laptop, or you may have to give up a beloved program that’s bogging things down. You’ll have to decide what sacrifices you’re willing to make in order to make your Windows PC faster.

1. Give it the reboot
2. Turn on high performance via the power slider
3. Undo some appearance options
4. Remove unneeded autoloaders
5. Stop resource-hogging processes
6. Turn off search indexing
7. Turn off Windows tips
8. Clean your internal drive
9. Check for malware
